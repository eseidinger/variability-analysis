# Variability Engineering Framework Documentation

Updated on October 1, 2026 to incorporate the broader variability-engineering vision, the food-service demonstration use case, and the binding food-service analysis MVP semantics. This documentation covers the product, target architecture, architectural decisions, development sequence, and prototype operations.

## Getting started

| Area | Key question | Documents |
|---|---|---|
| Product | Who is this for, and what should it achieve? | [Vision](01-product/vision.md), [Use cases](01-product/use-cases.md), [Requirements](01-product/requirements.md), [Roadmap](01-product/roadmap.md) |
| Architecture | How should modeling, analysis, configuration, and optimization work? | [Overview](02-architecture/overview.md), [Domain model](02-architecture/domain-model.md), [Analysis view](02-architecture/analysis-view.md), [Food-service MVP semantics](02-architecture/food-service-mvp-semantics.md), [Food-service HTTP contract](02-architecture/food-service-http-contract.md), [Persistence and deployment](02-architecture/persistence-and-deployment.md) |
| Decisions | Why was this approach selected? | [ADR index](03-decisions/README.md) |
| Development | What is built first, and how will it be verified? | [Development plan](04-development/development-plan.md), [MVP implementation plan](04-development/mvp-implementation-plan.md), [Quality assurance](04-development/quality-assurance.md), [Open decisions](04-development/open-decisions.md) |
| Traceability | Which sources support the baseline, and how is it maintained? | [Sources and maintenance](sources.md) |
| Operations | How will the prototype be deployed and checked? | [Deployment](05-operations/deployment.md) |

## Status and evidence

The food-service MVP is implemented across the Angular UI, Quarkus API, PostgreSQL persistence, and combined local container image. The API contains a domain-independent observed-population analysis core with unit and conformance tests, a verified food-service fixture adapter, and a public HTTP contract. The UI exposes summary metrics, filters, reorderable grouping, ingredient leverage, and ingredient-unavailability impact. Generative model evaluation and the broader framework capabilities remain planned; reusable framework components follow after the observed-population contracts have been validated further.

- **Requirement:** intended project scope, not implementation evidence.
- **Documented direction:** an objective recorded in the current project description.
- **Proposal:** a design requiring confirmation.
- **Open:** unresolved or insufficiently specified.
- **Accepted:** a binding design choice; acceptance does not by itself prove implementation.
- **Implemented:** reserved for behavior present in source.
- **Verified:** reserved for a recorded, reproducible check.

The repository evidences food-service UI behavior, local container assembly, a domain-independent analysis core, verified fixture import, PostgreSQL round trips, public API behavior, and a Compose-backed black-box workload check. It does not yet evidence generative model evaluation, configuration assistance, optimization, actual Docker Hub publication, or successful deployment to the Developer Platform.

## Maintenance

Use product documents for outcomes and scope, architecture documents for system design, ADRs for decisions and alternatives, development documents for sequencing and evidence, and operations documents for executable procedures. Update an ADR before changing an accepted architectural choice. Do not describe proposed or source-inspected behavior as operationally verified.
