# Product Vision

Status: documented direction; only the initial UI/API integration and local container assembly are implemented.

The Variability Engineering Framework provides a domain-independent way to model, analyze, configure, and optimize systems with many possible variants. A shared representation connects feature models, observed datasets, structural variants, impact scenarios, and portfolios so that analytical results remain comparable and explainable.

Development starts with a small runnable variability-analysis application. Food service is the first planned real-world demonstration because recipe data exposes observed variation, element reuse, supply impact, dietary coverage, and portfolio optimization in an accessible domain. Reusable framework components for Java, Python, TypeScript, Angular, and React are created later, after the prototype and reference domain establish stable semantics and contracts.

## Capabilities

- **Modeling:** represent generative configuration models and normalize imported observations through domain adapters.
- **Analysis:** explore configurations, candidate records, distinct variants, elements, and metrics through reorderable analysis dimensions.
- **Impact analysis:** compare a baseline with a scenario such as an unavailable element or an added constraint.
- **Configuration assistance:** complete partial requirements and explain compatible configurations and variants.
- **Optimization:** select portfolios under constraints and expose trade-offs between competing objectives.

## Target users

- Application developers reuse domain models, calculations, contracts, and visualization components.
- Domain users explore candidate records, structural variants, element usages, analysis dimensions, and the effects of changes.
- Decision makers compare feasible portfolios and the trade-offs between coverage, diversity, cost, sustainability, and operational complexity.
- Architecture and lab work uses the project as a reproducible workload for algorithm, persistence, and integration comparisons.

## Product boundaries

The project concerns variability models, observed variant populations, configuration spaces, configuration-dependent elements, impact scenarios, and portfolio decisions. Statistical variance and ANOVA are outside its core function. SaaS tenancy, authentication, a plugin system, and a broad infrastructure catalog are not approved scope. Large-scale solver integration, quantitative resource accounting, and multi-objective optimization are future capabilities rather than prototype commitments.
