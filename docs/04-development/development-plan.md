# Development Plan

Status: proposed sequence without confirmed dates.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Semantics[Semantics and stack] --> Core[Evaluation core]
    Core --> App[Prototype application]
    App --> Deploy[First deployment]
    Deploy --> Interactive[Interactive analysis]
    Interactive --> Normalize[Normalized populations]
    Normalize --> Food[Food-service demonstration]
    Food --> Impact[Impact and configuration]
    Impact --> Optimize[Portfolio optimization]
    Optimize --> Framework[Framework components]
    Framework --> Experiments[Additional domains and experiments]
```

The prototype application is the first integrated deliverable. The synthetic fixture establishes the generative semantics; the food-service demonstration then validates observed records, imported and derived dimensions, provenance, and portfolio needs. Framework components are created later from stable, verified contracts rather than treated as prerequisites.

```

Create only the directories required by current work. A future solver dependency belongs behind an optimization interface and is added only after an exhaustive fixture defines its semantics. Add implementation evidence and observed limitations as each milestone is completed.
