# Food-Service Analysis MVP HTTP Contract

Status: implemented, fixture-backed MVP contract. This contract exposes the binding [food-service analysis semantics](food-service-mvp-semantics.md) without placing HTTP types in the domain-independent core.

## Scope and population source

The API serves the checked-in `food-service-mvp` population at version `1.0.0`. It imports the fixture at application startup through the food-service adapter, stores it in PostgreSQL when that immutable ID/version is absent, and then serves the persisted population.

The fixture directory is configured by `variability.fixture.directory`; the development default is `../../../examples/food-service/mvp-v1`, relative to the API project directory.

All endpoints produce `application/json` below `/api/populations/{populationId}`. An unknown population or record returns `404`. Invalid identifiers, filters, dimensions, or scenarios return `400`.

## Shared response values

Every analytical response includes:

- `population.id` and `population.version`;
- `query`, echoing the normalized active filters, required elements, and grouping order; and
- `metrics`, containing record, structural-variant, and unique-element counts, plus per-element counts and frequencies.

`DimensionFilterRequest` has optional `requiredState` (`KNOWN` or `UNKNOWN`), `includedValues`, and `excludedValues`. Absent collections mean empty collections. Filters and required elements are combined with logical `AND` according to the binding MVP semantics.

## Endpoints

### Population summary

`GET /api/populations/food-service-mvp`

Returns population identity, complete artifact provenance, dimension definitions, unfiltered summary metrics, and rejected source rows.

### Record detail

`GET /api/populations/food-service-mvp/records/{recordId}`

Returns the population identity and one accepted record’s canonical `elementIds` and dimension values. Each dimension carries `state` and `values`, preserving `KNOWN` empty values separately from `UNKNOWN`.

### Analysis

`POST /api/populations/food-service-mvp/analysis`

Request example:

```json
{
  "dimensionFilters": {
    "diet": {"includedValues": ["VEGAN"]}
  },
  "requiredElementIds": ["tomato"],
  "groupingDimensions": ["cuisine", "dishType"]
}
```

Returns the shared analytical values, selected record IDs, and an ordered grouping tree. Each group path item has `dimensionId`, `valueKind` (`VALUE`, `KNOWN_EMPTY`, or `UNKNOWN`), and, for `VALUE`, `value`.

### Element leverage

`POST /api/populations/food-service-mvp/elements/{elementId}/leverage`

The body contains an optional `query` and optional `dimensionIds`. When omitted, `dimensionIds` defaults to `cuisine` and `diet`. The response includes the shared population/query context, the selected-record count for the element, and known values for each requested dimension.

### Element unavailability impact

`POST /api/populations/food-service-mvp/element-unavailability`

Request example:

```json
{
  "query": {"groupingDimensions": ["cuisine"]},
  "unavailableElementIds": ["garlic"]
}
```

`unavailableElementIds` is required and non-empty. The response includes the shared population/query context, the scenario rule, baseline and scenario analysis results, lost record IDs, lost structural variants, lost element IDs, root metric deltas, and grouped deltas. The operation excludes complete records and does not mutate the fixture population.

## Compatibility rule

The endpoint path identifies the population. Responses always identify the exact population version and fixture provenance, so a future persisted or changed fixture population can be exposed under a distinct version without reinterpreting an existing result.
