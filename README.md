# Variability Engineering Framework

A domain-independent framework for modeling, analyzing, configuring, and optimizing systems with many possible variants. Variability analysis is the first planned framework capability and remains the semantic foundation for the broader framework.

## Status

The food-service analysis MVP and combined container image have been validated locally against PostgreSQL. Deployment through the Developer Platform remains to be verified. GitHub Actions build and test the application and are configured to publish the image to Docker Hub, but an actual publication is not yet recorded.

The API contains a domain-independent analysis core for versioned observed populations, a verified food-service fixture adapter, an HTTP analysis contract, and PostgreSQL-backed population storage. The Angular Material dashboard exposes summary metrics, filtering, reorderable grouping, ingredient leverage, and ingredient-unavailability impact. Generative models, configuration assistance, portfolio optimization, and reusable framework components remain later work.

## Implemented MVP

The first application:

- imports and verifies a versioned synthetic food-service population;
- calculates record, structural-variant, ingredient, grouping, leverage, and unavailability results;
- saves and reloads the immutable population through PostgreSQL;
- presents the workload through an Angular UI and Quarkus API; and
- packages and verifies the UI and API as one local container image.

The stack-neutral workspace is documented in [`apps/prototype/`](apps/prototype/README.md).

The normative observed-data example is the [food-service MVP v1 fixture](examples/food-service/mvp-v1/README.md).

Generative model authoring, configuration assistance, portfolio optimization, external datasets, additional language implementations, reusable UI components, and broader performance or storage experiments follow in later stages.

## Core distinction

A **configuration** is a complete assignment of feature values. A structural **variant** is the resulting collection of present element usages. A **variant record** is an identified generated or imported candidate with dimensions and provenance. Different configurations or records can produce the same structural variant, so configuration count, record count, and distinct-variant count are separate metrics. A **portfolio** is a selected collection of variant records; in the food-service domain, a dish is a variant record and a menu is a portfolio.
